## üìö Literature Survey

Over time, financial time series forecasting has evolved significantly. Traditional models like ARIMA and GARCH, though initially effective in stock prediction, fall short in modeling the highly volatile and non-linear nature of cryptocurrencies. To overcome this, deep learning approaches such as LSTM and GRU have been adopted due to their strength in capturing temporal dependencies [1], [2]. However, they require large datasets and heavy computational resources.

Ensemble methods like **XGBoost** have gained attention for their scalability, built-in feature selection, and regularization capabilities, making them effective for financial prediction tasks [3], [4].
